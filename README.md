# Solid Catalog Viewer

I wanted to spend a day playing around with new frontend frameworks since I haven't been hands on with front end for quite a while.

The result is https://solid-catalog.jeswr.org, which is another interface for viewing the [Solid Catalog that Jeff Zucker is creating](https://github.com/solid-contrib/catalog?tab=readme-ov-file).

The stack used here was NextUI (UI Components) + Tailwind (Styling) + React + Typescript + Vercel (deployment) + LDO (by Jackson Morgan).
